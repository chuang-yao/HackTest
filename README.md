# HackTest: An Event-Driven Backtesting Framework in C++

HackTest is a library inspired by [a series of articles](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/) on [QuantStart](https://quantstart.com/) about event-driven backtesting with Python. It is written in C++ with the following in mind:

- High performance & low latency
- Code reusability
- Supporting a wide variety of order types
- Realistic modeling of transaction costs
