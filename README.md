# Project Proposal

*Chuang Yao, Jianqi Zhu, Kongjun Qin*

We will be developing an event-driven backtesting library (HackTest) as the course project for OOP I. HackTest will be a library inspired by [a series of articles](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/) on [QuantStart](https://quantstart.com/) about event-driven backtesting with Python. It will be written in C++ with the following in mind:

- object-oriented approach & code reusability
- high performance & low latency
- supporting a wide variety of order types
- realistic emulation of market transactions
- capable of handling real-time market data
- performance and risk management metrics

The library will likely function as illustrated bellow:
